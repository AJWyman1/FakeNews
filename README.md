# Detecting Fake News

![](img/news.png)

## The Problem

Fake news is the intentional spread of misinformation it has been in our society since the days of the printing press. Technology such as social media and news writing bots have increased both the spread and the amount of intentionally misleading articles. Being able to detect if an article is genuine or not is a difficult task for many of my Facebook friends, maybe machine learning and NLP will be able to help.

### **Raw Data**
[The dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset) was sourced from Kaggle. It comes in two separate csv files one containing Fake news articles and the other with True news articles both with ~20,000 articles the dataset was fairly evenly split at 51/49. Because of this even split I will be using accuracy as my scoring metric.

|  1 | Drunk Bragging Trump Staffer Started Russian Collusion Investigation                      | House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes is going to have a bad day. He s been under the assumption, like many of us, that the Christopher Steele-dossier was what prompted the Russia investigation so he s been lashing out at the Department of Justice and the FBI in order to protect Trump. As it happens, the dossier is not what started the investigation, according to documents obtained by the New York Times.Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos was drunk in a wine bar when he revealed knowledge of Russian opposition research on Hillary Clinton.On top of that, Papadopoulos wasn t just a covfefe boy for Trump, as his administration has alleged. He had a much larger role, but none so damning as being a drunken fool in a wine bar. Coffee boys  don t help to arrange a New York meeting between Trump and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt two months before the election. It was known before that the former aide set up meetings with world leaders for Trump, but team Trump ran with him being merely a coffee boy.In May 2016, Papadopoulos revealed to Australian diplomat Alexander Downer that Russian officials were shopping around possible dirt on then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Exactly how much Mr. Papadopoulos said that night at the Kensington Wine Rooms with the Australian, Alexander Downer, is unclear,  the report states.  But two months later, when leaked Democratic emails began appearing online, Australian officials passed the information about Mr. Papadopoulos to their American counterparts, according to four current and former American and foreign officials with direct knowledge of the Australians  role. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. and is now a cooperating witness with Special Counsel Robert Mueller s team.This isn t a presidency.

|  0 | As U.S. budget fight looms, Republicans flip their fiscal script | WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of a conservative Republican faction in the U.S. Congress, who voted this month for a huge expansion of the national debt to pay for tax cuts, called himself a “fiscal conservative” on Sunday and urged budget restraint in 2018. In keeping with a sharp pivot under way among Republicans, U.S. Representative Mark Meadows, speaking on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” drew a hard line on federal spending, which lawmakers are bracing to do battle over in January. When they return from the holidays on Wednesday, lawmakers will begin trying to pass a federal budget in a fight likely to be linked to other issues, such as immigration policy, even as the November congressional election campaigns approach in which Republicans will seek to keep control of Congress. President Donald Trump and his Republicans want a big budget increase in military spending, while Democrats also want proportional increases for non-defense “discretionary” spending on programs that support education, scientific research, infrastructure, public health and environmental protection. “The (Trump) administration has already been willing to say: ‘We’re going to increase non-defense discretionary spending ... by about 7 percent,’” Meadows, chairman of the small but influential House Freedom Caucus, said on the program. “Now, Democrats are saying that’s not enough, we need to give the government a pay raise of 10 to 11 percent. For a fiscal conservative, I don’t see where the rationale is. ... Eventually you run out of other people’s money,” he said. Meadows was among Republicans who voted in late December for their party’s debt-financed tax overhaul, which is expected to balloon the federal budget deficit and add about $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion national debt. “It’s interesting to hear Mark talk about fiscal responsibility,” Democratic U.S. Representative Joseph Crowley said on CBS. Crowley said the Republican tax bill would require the  United States to borrow $1.5 trillion, to be paid off by future generations, to finance tax cuts for corporations and the rich. “This is one of the least ... fiscally responsible bills we’ve ever seen passed in the history of the House of Representatives. I think we’re going to be paying for this for many, many years to come,” Crowley said. Republicans insist the tax package, the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in more than 30 years,  will boost the economy and job growth. House Speaker Paul Ryan, who also supported the tax bill, recently went further than Meadows, making clear in a radio interview that welfare or “entitlement reform,” as the party often calls it, would be a top Republican priority in 2018. In Republican parlance, “entitlement” programs mean food stamps, housing assistance, Medicare and Medicaid health insurance for the elderly, poor and disabled, as well as other programs created by Washington to assist the needy. Democrats seized on Ryan’s early December remarks, saying they showed Republicans would try to pay for their tax overhaul by seeking spending cuts for social programs. But the goals of House Republicans may have to take a back seat to the Senate, where the votes of some Democrats will be needed to approve a budget and prevent a government shutdown. Democrats will use their leverage in the Senate, which Republicans narrowly control, to defend both discretionary non-defense programs and social spending, while tackling the issue of the “Dreamers,” people brought illegally to the country as children. Trump in September put a March 2018 expiration date on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which protects the young immigrants from deportation and provides them with work permits. The president has said in recent Twitter messages he wants funding for his proposed Mexican border wall and other immigration law changes in exchange for agreeing to help the Dreamers. Representative Debbie Dingell told CBS she did not favor linking that issue to other policy objectives, such as wall funding. “We need to do DACA clean,” she said.  On Wednesday, Trump aides will meet with congressional leaders to discuss those issues. That will be followed by a weekend of strategy sessions for Trump and Republican leaders on Jan. 6 and 7, the White House said. Trump was also scheduled to meet on Sunday with Florida Republican Governor Rick Scott, who wants more emergency aid. The House has passed an $81 billion aid package after hurricanes in Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico, and wildfires in California. The package far exceeded the $44 billion requested by the Trump administration. The Senate has not yet voted on the aid. | politicsNews | December 31, 2017 |
|  1 | U.S. military to accept transgender recruits on Monday: Pentagon | WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Transgender people will be allowed for the first time to enlist in the U.S. military starting on Monday as ordered by federal courts, the Pentagon said on Friday, after President Donald Trump’s administration decided not to appeal rulings that blocked his transgender ban. Two federal appeals courts, one in Washington and one in Virginia, last week rejected the administration’s request to put on hold orders by lower court judges requiring the military to begin accepting transgender recruits on Jan. 1. A Justice Department official said the administration will not challenge those rulings. “The Department of Defense has announced that it will be releasing an independent study of these issues in the coming weeks. So rather than litigate this interim appeal before that occurs, the administration has decided to wait for DOD’s study and will continue to defend the president’s lawful authority in District Court in the meantime,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. In September, the Pentagon said it had created a panel of senior officials to study how to implement a directive by Trump to prohibit transgender individuals from serving. The Defense Department has until Feb. 21 to submit a plan to Trump. Lawyers representing currently-serving transgender service members and aspiring recruits said they had expected the administration to appeal the rulings to the conservative-majority Supreme Court, but were hoping that would not happen. Pentagon spokeswoman Heather Babb said in a statement: “As mandated by court order, the Department of Defense is prepared to begin accessing transgender applicants for military service Jan. 1. All applicants must meet all accession standards.” Jennifer Levi, a lawyer with gay, lesbian and transgender advocacy group GLAD, called the decision not to appeal “great news.” “I’m hoping it means the government has come to see that there is no way to justify a ban and that it’s not good for the military or our country,” Levi said. Both GLAD and the American Civil Liberties Union represent plaintiffs in the lawsuits filed against the administration. In a move that appealed to his hard-line conservative supporters, Trump announced in July that he would prohibit transgender people from serving in the military, reversing Democratic President Barack Obama’s policy of accepting them. Trump said on Twitter at the time that the military “cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.” Four federal judges - in Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Seattle and Riverside, California - have issued rulings blocking Trump’s ban while legal challenges to the Republican president’s policy proceed. The judges said the ban would likely violate the right under the U.S. Constitution to equal protection under the law. The Pentagon on Dec. 8 issued guidelines to recruitment personnel in order to enlist transgender applicants by Jan. 1. The memo outlined medical requirements and specified how the applicants’ sex would be identified and even which undergarments they would wear. The Trump administration previously said in legal papers that the armed forces were not prepared to train thousands of personnel on the medical standards needed to process transgender applicants and might have to accept “some individuals who are not medically fit for service.” The Obama administration had set a deadline of July 1, 2017, to begin accepting transgender recruits. But Trump’s defense secretary, James Mattis, postponed that date to Jan. 1, 2018, which the president’s ban then put off indefinitely. Trump has taken other steps aimed at rolling back transgender rights. In October, his administration said a federal law banning gender-based workplace discrimination does not protect transgender employees, reversing another Obama-era position. In February, Trump rescinded guidance issued by the Obama administration saying that public schools should allow transgender students to use the restroom that corresponds to their gender identity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | politicsNews | December 29, 2017 |

## Word Clouds & EDA

Staring with word clouds
### Fake news word cloud from title

### True news word cloud from title

## Exploring the text with VADER sentiment analysis 

Starting off I explored using VADER sentiment analysis to derive features for my model to train on. VADER is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool, which when given text outputs four different scores `compound`,  `positivity`,  `negativity`, and `neutrality`. I expected that True news would score higher on neutrality because news reports should be unbiased 

![](img/all_four_with_zeros.png)

Performing sentiment analysis on the full text yields some interesting results! True news scores a -1 compound score far less than Fake news and the neutrality score is higher on average!

## First Model

Training a `RandomForestClassifier` on only the sentiment scores for the full text of the article produces an Accuracy score of **.692**! This is above what we would expect from just random guessing.

## **Sentiment analysis of Titles**



![](img/all_four.png)

Its a little hard to see the distribution with large spikes at the zero mark. However, there are far more True news articles that have a compound score of 0 and also scores higher on neutrality as anticipated. Also when graded on negativity fake news scores higher on average with a lot fewer articles scoring zero.

**Removing Zeros:**

![](img/all_four_no_zeros.png)

With the large spikes removed it is easier to see the underlying distributions such as Fake news with far more compound scores in the negative, True news still with higher Neutrality scores and scoring slightly more positive and less non-zero negative scores.

## Second Model

Again training a `RandomForestClassifier` but this time on the sentiment scores of just the article's title results in an impressive **.763 accuracy**!

Combining both sentiment of the title and full text of the article produces a **.801 accuracy**!!!

# NLP

Training models on just the sentiment analysis of the articles is clearly effective but in doing so we throw out the largest source of data in the corpus; the actual words. 

## **TfidfVectorizer**

Using tf-idf we can change from words to numbers I chose this because it offers more information on how often a word is used not just in a single document but also how unique it is to the rest of the documents in the corpus

Stop words added:
`'reuters' '21st', 'century', 'wire', '21wire', 'www', 'https', 'com', 'pic'`

I chose these stop words because they were either part of links embedded into the article or a source of data leakage.

With the stop words out of the way it was time to vectorize the corpus.

## **Naive Bayes**
--- 

Training a Naive Bayes model of the vectorized tf-idf and returning the top 12 features from the model we can see some interesting trends. Four out of the top six features for Fake news are people's names (Trump, Clinton, Obama, Hillary) while True news seems to larger groups of people (state, house, government). 

Word Rank | Fake News | True News
---------|----------|---------
 1 | Trump | said
 2 | Clinton | Trump
 3 | Obama | president
 4 | people | state
 5 | president | house
 6 | Hillary | government
 7 | just | Washington
 8 | said | republican
 9 | like | united
 10 | Donald | states
 11 | twitter | north
 12 | news | new

The Naive Bayes model performed surprisingly well with:


**0.930 Accuracy**

---
---
### **Bi-grams** (_two words_)
---
---

Changing the model's hyper-parameters and looking at groups of two words together people's full names appear. We can also see that True news has far more credible sources such as actual statements and quotes while Fake news focuses on images and youtube for their sources.


Word Rank | Fake News | True News
---------|----------|---------
 1 | Donald Trump | United States
 2 | Hillary Clinton | North Korea
 3 | featured image | white house
 4 | white house | Donald Trump
 5 | President Trump | President Donald
 6 | President Obama | Prime minister
 7 | United States | said statement
 8 | getty images | Islamic state
 9 | fox news | told reporters 
 10 | New York| Trump said
 11 | year old| New York
 12 |youtube watch| Washington President

**0.953 Accuracy**

---
---
---
### **Tri-Grams** (_three sequential words_)
---
---
---

Exploring tri-grams we see an interesting shift with True News featuring far more people's names than Fake news which is again relying on screenshots, videos and at the top of the list a twitter handle. 

Word Rank | Fake News | True News
---------|----------|---------
 1 | Donald Trump realdonaldtrump | President Donald Trump
 2 | black lives matter | President Barack Obama
 3 | New York Times | Washington President Donald
 4 | president United States | white house said
 5 | featured image video | president elect Donald 
 6 | video screen capture | elect Donald Trump
 7 | image video screen | President Vladimir Putin
 8 | President Barack Obama | Prime Minister Theresa
 9 | featured image screenshot | state Rex Tillerson
 10 | President Donald Trump | secretary state Rex
 11 | New York City | Donald Trump said
 12 | image screen capture | Russian President Vladimir

**0.971 Accuracy**


### **Random Forest**
---
Exploring a random forest using `n-gram = 1` we see 'said' as the most important feature when determining Fake or Real



 | Feature      | Feature Importances
----------------|-----------------
 | said         | 0.042
 | washington   | 0.012
 | featured     | .010
 | image        | 0.010
 | minister     | 0.007


This RandomForest produced an incredible  
**0.979 Accuracy**

# Conclusion

There are trends that appear in both fake and true news that make them distinguishable from each other  with fake news relying on twitter, images and videos far more often than actual news. While true news relies far more on facts and actual statements. Fake news only exists to divide us as people.


 # Further work

 I would like to explore this dataset further and perform topic modeling to see what topics do both Fake and Real news talk about.

 I also would like to explore how well a quadra-gram (_groups of four words_) would perform
